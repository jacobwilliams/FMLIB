This file extends the FM_User_Manual.txt file for the files that support the FM interval arithmetic
package.  All of these programs use the 3 basic files discussed there:

1.  FMSAVE.f95        Module for FM internal global variables

2.  FM.f95            Subroutine library for multiple-precision operations

3.  FMZM90.f95        Modules for interfaces and definitions of derived-types

These are the files included for interval arithmetic.

4.  fm_interval.f95          The routines and interfaces for interval operations

5.  TestFMinterval.f95       Test program for the FM interval routines

6.  SampleFMinterval.f95     Small sample program using fm_interval

7.  IntervalExamplesFM.f95   Code for the example interval calculations that are discussed in the
                             paper "A Multiple-Precision Interval Arithmetic Package"


After the first 3 files have been compiled and the program TestFM.f95 has been compiled and run
to verify the basic FM package has been installed successfully, as shown in FM_User_Manual.txt,
files 4 through 7 can be compiled and run.

The interval arithmetic operations are made available in the user's program by putting
       USE FM_INTERVAL_ARITHMETIC
at the top of routines using interval arithmetic, and the multiple precision interval variables
are declared as
       TYPE (FM_INTERVAL)

Here are sample commands to run the 3 programs in files 5, 6, and 7.  These are for the gfortran
compiler on a Windows PC.  Macs are very similar, as are other compilers.  See FM_User_Manual.txt.


    gfortran fm_interval.f95  -c -O3


    gfortran TestFMinterval.f95  -c -O3

    gfortran  fmsave.o  FM.o  FMZM90.o  fm_interval.o  TestFMinterval.o  -o TestFMinterval.exe

    ./TestFMinterval


    gfortran SampleFMinterval.f95  -c -O3

    gfortran  fmsave.o  FM.o  FMZM90.o  fm_interval.o  SampleFMinterval.o  -o SampleFMinterval.exe

    ./SampleFMinterval


    gfortran IntervalExamplesFM.f95  -c -O3

    gfortran  fmsave.o  FM.o  FMZM90.o  fm_interval.o  IntervalExamplesFM.o  -o IntervalExamplesFM.exe

    ./IntervalExamplesFM


TestFMinterval is a program that tests all the interval operations defined in the FM interval
arithmetic package.  Run it first to make sure that the interval package has been successfully
installed.  At the end of the run, it should say:

  1044 cases tested.  No errors were found.


SampleFMinterval is a small program showing how to do some interval calculations.  It checks a
sum for stability and accuracy using 4 methods and compares the results:

  1.  Do the sum in double precision
  2.  Use FM with increasing precision
  3.  Use FM with different rounding modes
  4.  Use FM with interval arithmetic

SampleFMinterval also tests a recurrence that is horribly unstable using FM vs FM interval
arithmetic.  The results are saved in the file SampleFMinterval.out.


IntervalExamplesFM is a program that runs the example interval calculations that are discussed
in the paper "A Multiple-Precision Interval Arithmetic Package".  The results are saved in file
IntervalExamplesFM.out.

The program also produces 7 other output files that contain the data on how the width of the
intervals increase at each step of the calculation for different examples in the paper.  These
files were used to produce the graphs in the paper showing rate of increase for interval width.

The basic arithmetic operations are provided, along with assignments and logical comparisons.
